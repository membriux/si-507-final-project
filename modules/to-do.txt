Memo:
    Retrieve inputs from user
    - Web app templating
        • Create input items and retrieve inputs
        • Create HTML table and make it pretty
        • Add clickable business that shows details of reviews
    - Use [Businesses] and list them in a table in HTML
        • Use bootstrap for nice templating

Additional changes I made:
Business.py
    - added sentiment_score (float) attribute to Business class
    - overall_sentiment -> string (i.e. 'Neutral', Positive', 'Negative' )
        • sentiment_score is the original overall_sentiment
    - Changed function name:
        • _calculate_overall_sentiment -> _calculate_sentiment_score
    - Added function _get_overall_sentiment that returns string for overall_sentiment

Josh:
    Finish classes for business, analyzer, review
    -  unction for get_reviews and get_overall_sentiment (Busines.py)
    -  Function to get_sentiment_of_review(review) on Review class
    -  Create function that takes in search input of food and city
        ****** • return [Businesses] ******
    clean up code
